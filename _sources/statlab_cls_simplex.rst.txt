*************
Background
*************

For multi-class classification, the sum of probability of individual classes is restricted to one [1]_. 
This page includes discussions related to the space of probability values on a simplex.

*************
Notation 
*************

Let :math:`Y_{i}=c` be the class (group) of the :math:`i` th sample 
for :math:`i = 1, \ldots, n`, 
with class value :math:`c \in \{c_1,\ldots, c_K\}`, 
:math:`P(Y_i = c_k) = p_k`,
:math:`p_k \in [0,1]` for all :math:`k`,
and :math:`\sum_k p_k=1`.
Let :math:`N_k = \sum_{i=1}^n I(Y_i = c_k)`,
:math:`N = (N_1, \ldots, N_K)` with :math:`N_k \geq 0` and :math:`\sum_k N_k = n`.
The vector :math:`N` is a :math:`K` components compositional data point.
Let :math:`\hat{p} = (\hat{p}_1, \ldots, \hat{p}_K) \in [0,1]^K` with :math:`\sum_k \hat{p}_k = 1`.
The value space of :math:`\{\hat{p}\}` is a :math:`(K-1)`-dimensional standard (normalized) simplex [2]_.



*************
Example - Group-1
*************

.. list-table:: Spearman's :math:`\rho = 1.0`
   :widths: 10 10 10 
   :header-rows: 1
   :name: tbl_ex1

   * - 
     - :math:`Y_{i1}`
     - :math:`Y_{i2}`
   * - **Sample:** 1
     - 1
     - 4
   * - **Sample:** 2
     - 3
     - 6
   * - **Sample:** 3
     - 2
     - 5

.. list-table:: Spearman's :math:`\rho = -1.0`
   :widths: 10 10 10 
   :header-rows: 1
   :name: tbl_ex1

   * - 
     - :math:`Y_{i1}`
     - :math:`Y_{i2}`
   * - **Sample:** 1
     - 1
     - 6
   * - **Sample:** 2
     - 3
     - 4
   * - **Sample:** 3
     - 2
     - 5

*************
How-to 
*************

To use ``scipy.stats`` [3]_:

.. code:: python

  from scipy.stats import spearmanr

  y1 = [1, 3, 2]
  y2 = [4, 6, 5]

  rho, p_value = spearmanr(y1, y2)
  print("Spearman's rho:", rho)
